### What is DP (Dynamic Programming)?

DP is a combination of a recursive solution/approach and optimization.

**Optimization:** Removing **duplicate calls** and reducing time complexity through memoization.

There are two types of DP:
1. Top-down (recursion with memoization)
2. Bottom-up (iteration using loops)

Both approaches stem from the same concept. The core idea is the recursive process. In many algorithms, we choose the DP approach for efficiency.
