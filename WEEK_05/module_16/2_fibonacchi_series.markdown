### Fibonacci sequence

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...

The pattern follows this rule: each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Specifically:

0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 5 = 8
5 + 8 = 13
8 + 13 = 21
The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and every subsequent number is obtained by adding the two numbers before it. This sequence appears in many mathematical contexts and natural phenomena.
