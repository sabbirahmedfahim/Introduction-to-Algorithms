### DFS stands for Depth-First Search.
Both BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS are traversal algorithms. BFS traverses in the shortest path, while DFS traverses deeper into the graph before backtracking. Their time complexity is similar: O(V+E).

### So why do we use DFS instead of BFS?
Since their time complexity is the same, DFS traversal is comparatively easier to implement. If we don't need the shortest path, DFS can be a simpler option, requiring less code.
