In a binary tree, there are three popular traversal algorithms: pre-order, in-order, and post-order. However, in graphs, there is a single traversal algorithm that is somewhat similar to these, known as DFS (Depth-First Search), depth-order. which also uses a recursive approach and follows a **depth-first order**.
