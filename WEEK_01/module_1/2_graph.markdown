### Conditions of graph
1. Can be multiple edge connection(binary tree has single edge)
2. Can be go through multiple ways 
3. Can be trapped in a cycle(tree has no cycle because)
4. Edge direction parent->children or children->parent possible(like tree has parent->children one way direction)
5. Tree consept comes from graph. So graph eliminates trees limitations
