# ðŸŒŸ **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** ðŸŒŸ

### **Definition:**
The **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** is a subsequence that appears in both strings in the same order but not necessarily consecutively.

### **Example:**

```cpp
string x = "abh", y = "ahg";
```
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) for these two strings is:
```cpp
"ah"
```

### **Minimum Valid Input ðŸ§®**
The minimum valid input for a string is zero.
If both strings have zero length, the answer (total count of LCS) is zero.

So, if:
```cpp
string x = "", y = "";
```
The LCS count is 0. ðŸš«
