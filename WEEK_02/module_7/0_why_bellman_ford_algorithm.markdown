## üìå When to Use Which Shortest-Path Algorithm?

| Algorithm         | Time Complexity       | Graph Type       | Negative Weights? | Use Case                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **DFS**           | ‚ùå (Not shortest!)    | Any              | ‚ùå                | Graph traversal, cycles, topology        |
| **BFS**           | `O(N+E)`             | Unweighted       | ‚ùå                | **Shortest path** (unweighted graphs)    |
| **Dijkstra**      | `O((N+E)logN)`       | Weighted (‚â•0)    | ‚ùå                | Fastest for positive weights             |
| **Bellman-Ford**  | `O(N‚ãÖE)`             | Weighted (¬±)     | ‚úÖ                | Handles negative weights, detects cycles |
| **Floyd-Warshall**| `O(N¬≥)`              | ‚ö†Ô∏è All-Pairs    | ‚úÖ               | **All nodes** shortest paths             |

### BSF Algorithm
**BFS**: Complexity O(N + E). BFS only works for unweighted graphs.

### Dijkstra Algorithm
**Dijkstra**: It works on weighted graphs, but it doesn't handle negative weights properly. Specifically, **Dijkstra's algorithm fails in the presence of a negative weight cycle**. In such cases, it can enter an infinite loop because it keeps trying to reduce the total cost.

**The images show an infinite loop!** This occurs due to a negative weight cycle, which Dijkstra cannot handle. To address this, we use the Bellman-Ford algorithm. **It‚Äôs important to understand two terms: negative weight and negative weight cycle.** Dijkstra can handle negative weights as long as they don‚Äôt form a cycle. **If it's confirmed that no negative weight cycles exist in the graph, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used safely.**

### Bellman Ford Algorithm
**Bellman Ford Algorithm**: 
   Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford works for graphs with negative weights and is **capable of detecting and handling negative weight cycles.**
