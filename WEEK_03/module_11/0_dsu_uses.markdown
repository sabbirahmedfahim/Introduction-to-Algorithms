### WHy we use DSU?

**Cycle detection in an unweighted graph:** DSU is used to detect cycles in undirected, unweighted graphs. It doesn't work directly with weighted graphs because it doesn't account for edge weights or directions; its focus is on node connectivity.


**Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** DSU is used in Kruskal's Algorithm to help find the MST by efficiently managing the merging of sets when adding edges.
