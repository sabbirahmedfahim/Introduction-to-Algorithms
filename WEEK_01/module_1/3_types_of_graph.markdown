1. **Undirected graph** : Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. **The edges indicate a two-way relationship**, meaning each edge can be traversed in both directions.

1. **Directed graph** : Did you assume that in a directed graph, there is only a single direction? What if some nodes have a direction and some are undirected? It's still a directed graph!

In an undirected graph, each edge maintains a two-way relationship. Does this mean two nodes form a cycle? No! We do not assume it as a cycle. A minimum of three nodes is needed.

But in a directed graph, even two edges can form a cycle.
